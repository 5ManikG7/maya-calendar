Tools for converting between Maya and Western calendars.

The Classic Maya developed the most sophisticated system for keeping track of time in the New World. In this app, you can convert dates from the Maya Calendar (Long Count and Calendar Round) to the Gregorian or Julian Calendars and vice-versa. You can also check the Maya glyphs for the current date. More features will be added in future versions.
